# Agent Gateway Protocol (AGP) Architecture

## Overview

The Agent Gateway Protocol (AGP) provides a standardized architecture for building distributed agent applications. It enables seamless communication between client applications and remote agent services through a gateway intermediary, allowing for scalable, secure, and flexible AI agent deployments.

```
Client <-----> Gateway <----> Server
```

This architecture creates a clear separation of concerns:

- **Client**: Manages the user interface and agent workflow
- **Gateway**: Handles message routing and protocol conversion
- **Server**: Processes agent requests and executes AI logic

The AGP architecture is ideal for scenarios where agent processing needs to be:
- Offloaded to specialized servers
- Distributed across multiple services
- Isolated for security or performance reasons
- Scaled independently of client applications

## Components

### 1. Client (Remote Agent Client)

The client component is typically built using Langgraph and is responsible for:

- Initializing connections to the gateway
- Creating and managing the state graph for handling requests
- Processing user inputs and displaying agent outputs
- Managing message flow and state transitions

**Key Components:**

```python
# Example client-side graph setup
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from typing import TypedDict, List

# Define state structure
class GraphState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[dict]
    session_id: str

# Create nodes for the graph
def node_remote_agp(state: GraphState) -> GraphState:
    """Node that handles communication with remote agent via AGP"""
    # Implementation details for sending/receiving through gateway
    return updated_state

# Build the graph
def build_graph():
    graph = StateGraph(GraphState)
    graph.add_node("remote_agent", node_remote_agp)
    # Additional graph configuration
    return graph.compile()
```

### 2. Gateway (Message Broker)

The gateway acts as an intermediary between clients and servers:

- Runs as a service (typically on port 46357)
- Handles message routing and protocol conversion
- Manages connections and message queues
- Provides a secure communication channel between components

**Key Features:**

- **GatewayContainer**: Manages gateway connections and message routing
- **Protocol Conversion**: Translates between different messaging formats
- **Connection Management**: Handles client and server connections
- **Message Queuing**: Ensures reliable message delivery

### 3. Server (Remote Agent Server)

The server component is typically built using FastAPI and is responsible for:

- Processing requests from the gateway
- Implementing the remote agent logic
- Managing agent state and context
- Returning responses to the client via the gateway

**Key Components:**

```python
# Example server implementation using FastAPI
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class AgentRequest(BaseModel):
    messages: List[dict]
    session_id: str

@app.post("/agent/process")
async def process_agent_request(request: AgentRequest):
    # Process the agent request
    # Generate response using AI models
    return {"response": generated_response}
```

## Message Flow

### 1. Client Initiates Request

```
Client -> Gateway
```

The client creates a request payload and sends it to the gateway:

```python
# Client-side code
payload = {
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, agent!"}],
    "session_id": "unique-session-id"
}

# Send via GatewayContainer
response = await gateway_container.send_and_receive(payload)
```

### 2. Gateway Handles Routing

```
Gateway -> Server
```

The gateway:
- Receives the client message
- Routes it to the appropriate server endpoint
- Manages any protocol conversions
- Handles authentication and security

### 3. Server Processes Request

```
Server -> Gateway -> Client
```

The server:
- Processes the request through FastAPI routes
- Executes agent logic using AI models
- Returns the response through the gateway
- May include streaming responses for real-time interaction

## Security

The AGP architecture includes several security features:

### Connection Security

- TLS/SSL support for encrypted communication
- Configurable insecure connections for development
- Authentication mechanisms for client and server validation

### Data Protection

- Environment variables for sensitive configuration
- CORS protection for web-based clients
- Secure credential management

### Request Validation

- Custom route ID generation for request tracking
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting and throttling capabilities

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run an AGP-based application:

### Prerequisites

1. Python 3.12 or higher
2. OpenAI API key (or other LLM provider)
3. Docker (recommended for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Set up the client:

```bash
# Navigate to client directory
cd client
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure environment:

```bash
# Create .env file with your API keys
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env
```

3. Build and run the gateway:

```bash
# Using Docker
docker compose up gateway
```

4. Start the server:

```bash
# Using Docker
docker compose up server
```

5. Run the client application:

```bash
# Start the client
python client/agp.py
```

### Development with Langgraph Studio

For development with Langgraph Studio:

1. Start the gateway and server components
2. Navigate to the client_studio directory
3. Execute Langgraph development server:

```bash
langgraph dev
```

### Customizing Your Agent

To customize your agent's behavior:

1. Modify the server-side agent implementation
2. Update the client-side graph to handle new capabilities
3. Test your changes with example conversations
4. Deploy updates to your production environment

## Conclusion

The Agent Gateway Protocol architecture provides a flexible foundation for building distributed agent applications. By separating concerns between client, gateway, and server components, it enables scalable and secure agent deployments that can evolve with your application needs.
