# Agent Connect Protocol (ACP) with Simple Agent Framework

Welcome to the Agent Connect Protocol (ACP) tutorial series using Galileo's Simple Agent Framework. This repository provides step-by-step tutorials, examples, and resources to help you understand and implement the Agent Connect Protocol for creating powerful, distributed AI agent applications.

## What is Agent Connect Protocol (ACP)?

The [Agent Connect Protocol (ACP)](https://github.com/agntcy/acp-spec/) is an open specification that defines a standard interface to invoke and configure agents. It enables seamless integration between different agent systems by providing a common language for agent communication.

ACP provides standardized patterns for:

- Defining and discovering agent capabilities
- Invoking agents with standardized request formats
- Supporting various execution modes (sync, async, streaming)
- Configuring remote agents with consistent parameters
- Handling responses and errors with uniform formats
- Enabling cross-framework agent interoperability

This specification is developed with the support of the Internet of Agents (IoA) community, with the goal of facilitating cross-framework agent interoperability, allowing agents built with different frameworks to communicate seamlessly.

## ACP Technical Overview

The ACP specification defines a comprehensive set of APIs and patterns for agent interactions:

### Agent Discovery and Descriptors

Agents expose their capabilities through **Agent ACP Descriptors**, which contain:

- **Metadata**: Unique identifiers, version information, and descriptions
- **Capabilities**: Supported features (threads, interrupts, callbacks, streaming)
- **Schema Definitions**: JSON schemas for inputs, outputs, configuration, and thread states

Clients can retrieve agent information through:
- `POST /agents/search` - Find agents by name, version, or other criteria
- `GET /agents/{agent_id}/descriptor` - Retrieve the full descriptor for a specific agent

### Agent Interaction Patterns

ACP supports several key interaction patterns:

1. **Runs**: Single agent executions
   - Start runs with `POST /runs`
   - Poll for completion with `GET /runs/{run_id}`
   - Wait for completion with `GET /runs/{run_id}/wait`

2. **Streaming**: Real-time partial results
   - Receive incremental updates via Server-Sent Events
   - Support for both "values" mode (complete results) and "custom" streaming

3. **Threads**: Conversational state management
   - Create threads with `POST /threads`
   - Start runs on threads with `POST /threads/{thread_id}/runs`
   - Access thread history with `GET /threads/{thread_id}`

4. **Interrupts**: Agent-initiated interactions
   - Receive requests for additional input from agents
   - Provide needed information to resume processing

5. **Callbacks**: Asynchronous notifications
   - Register callbacks to be notified of run status changes

## The Simple Agent Framework

This tutorial series is built around the [Simple Agent Framework](https://github.com/rungalileo/simple-agent-framework) from Galileo, which provides a flexible foundation for building AI agents with:

- Tool-based capabilities
- State management
- Prompt templating
- Advanced logging
- Configuration management

We extend this framework to implement the Agent Connect Protocol, enabling distributed agent communication across different systems and environments.

## Example Applications

The repository includes complete, working examples that demonstrate ACP in action:

- [Remote Agent](remote_agent_agp/README.md) - A template for building remote agent applications
TODO:
- [Thread-Based Chat](thread_chat_demo) - Demonstrates thread state management (Coming soon!)
TODO:
- [Streaming Agent](streaming_demo) - Shows real-time streaming capabilities (Coming soon!)
TODO:
- [Interrupt-Based Workflow](interrupt_workflow) - Demonstrates interactive agent interrupts (Coming soon!)

## ACP Implementation Patterns

Throughout these tutorials, we'll demonstrate several key patterns for implementing ACP:

TODO: highlight where these need to be done

1. **Agent ACP Descriptor Implementation**
   - Creating schema definitions for agent capabilities
   - Registering and exposing agent descriptors

2. **Run Management**
   - Starting and tracking agent runs
   - Processing inputs and outputs according to ACP standards

3. **Thread State Handling**
   - Creating and managing conversational state
   - Persisting and retrieving thread history

4. **Streaming Implementation**
   - Implementing real-time output streaming
   - Processing streaming responses on the client side

5. **Interrupt Handling**
   - Creating agents that request additional input
   - Handling and responding to agent interrupts

## Prerequisites

To work through these tutorials, you'll need:

- Python 3.12+
- Basic understanding of REST APIs and asynchronous programming
- OpenAI API key (or other LLM provider)
- Docker (for containerized deployments)
